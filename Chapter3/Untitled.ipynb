    "If you are using the workspace, be aware that saving large files can create issues with backing up your work. You'll be saving a model checkpoint in Part 1 of this project which can be multiple GBs in size if you use a large classifier network. Dense networks can get large very fast since you are creating N x M weight matrices for each new layer. In general, it's better to avoid wide layers and instead use more hidden layers, this will save a lot of space. Keep an eye on the size of the checkpoint you create. You can open a terminal and enter ls -lh to see the sizes of the files. If your checkpoint is greater than 1 GB, reduce the size of your classifier network and re-save the checkpoint."
